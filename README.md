On December 30th 2022, 180 hackers from around the world travelled to the Delhi NCR for Epoch ‚Äî a 42-hour high-school hackathon over New Year's. With clubs & hackers in 130+ countries, Hack Club is a truly global community. After many magical summer events in the USA, Epoch was Hack Club's first flagship event outside of the United States. The Hack Club community came together to organise Epoch, the goal of this repository is to document that journey for future organisers to reference.
