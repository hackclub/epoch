On December 30th 2022, 180 hackers from around the world travelled to the Delhi NCR for Epoch — a 42-hour high-school hackathon over New Year's. With clubs & hackers in 130+ countries, Hack Club is a truly global community. After many magical summer events in the USA, Epoch was Hack Club's first flagship event outside of the United States. The Hack Club community came together to organise Epoch, the goal of this repository is to document that journey for future organisers to reference.

**The Event’s Vision:** An epic, global high schooler-led hackathon organised in public to inspire the community and bring hundreds of Hack Clubbers together in Asia in the winter - the most epic hackathon this winter

**Budget:** $40K for event itself. $4K emergency budget for day-of. There will be more costs around sending HQ staff and making a film, etc., this will come from HQ & not be in the event’s budget.

**Staffing:** High schooler led, with HQ staff support and involved.

**Problem Statements:**

1. Lots of hackathons are being organised right now in #hackathon-organizers, and they need more support than we’re currently providing - especially around vision, marketing, and logistics.
2. It’d be one thing for us to write tutorials on how we think people should run their hackathons, but 1) we think people are better suited to run an awesome event for their community than we are, and 2) the Hack Club ethos is not to be instructional, but rather role model the behavior we want others to see.
3. We want this to be the most epic hackathon happening on the planet in the next 6 months. How can we make it feel like a truly global event? Attendees internationally, organised in public on the Slack, truly a global community event that happens to be happening in Asia.
4. How can we make sure everyone hearing about the event walks away thinking “Hack Club is amazing, and I want to get more involved”?
