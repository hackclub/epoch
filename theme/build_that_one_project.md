**Theme suggestion:** Build (or finish!) that one project you've always wanted to, but have been procrastinating on.

**Alternatively:** Take an old project that you stopped working on and revive it with a rewrite or new features!

This is in the spirit of New Year's resolutions, and is also pretty open ended to give attendees a lot of freedom :D
