## ðŸ¦  COVID-19

## Before the Hackathon

### Vaccination Requirements

All attendees will be required to have full vaccination against COVID-19.

### COVID Self Testing

We require all attendees & organisers to take a antigen test within 24 hours of the event or (if flying) before you leave to travel. Those positive may not enter the venue.

## At the Hackathon

### Resources

Rapid tests will be available on-request for those feeling unwell and hand sanitizer will be located throughout the venue.

Masks are not required at the venue, but single-use masks will be available for anyone who wishes to wear one.

### Self-report Response

If an attendee or organizer begins to show symptoms and/or has a positive test, they must isolate and leave the event. They are responsible for coordinating housing and rebooking travel if needed.

We will send a notification email to attendees with exposure details if there is a positive test.

## After the Hackathon

### Reporting Post-event Positive Tests

If an attendee or organizer has a positive test within 7 days of the event, they should report the possible exposure to self-report link made available after the event.

To ensure attendees and organizers remember to self-report after the event, a scheduled text message will be sent with the self-report link.

## ðŸ›Ÿ Additional Day-of Safety

### Point of Contact

There will be two designated adult safety points of contact, one female and one male. Both will be employed by Hack Club and will have the necessary background checks. They'll be introduced at the opening ceremony and their phone numbers will be made available to all attendees through email.

### Sleeping

We will have a gender-seperated & adult-supervised space for sleeping within the venue. Supervising adults will be available to respond to any situations that arise.

### Supervision

At all times, there will be at least two adults and ten members of the Epoch student team on site. All adult staff members will have the necessary background checks.

### The Venue

The venue is closed doors which means that only those that have registered will be allowed to enter the venue. Once the event begins and bar an emergency, only event staff will be able to enter and exit the venue. Building security will be present at all times.

## ðŸ›« Travel Safety

### Dedicated Point of Contact

A dedicated travel point of contact will be established. They will be available to support attendees as they travel to and from the event. This will be a remote role, to ensure they are focused. They will be armed with all required travel information.

### Airport Chaperoning

Attendees will be able to travel alongside event staff to the venue from Indira Gandhi International Airport, if there inbound flight arrives on Friday (after 8:00) or their outbound flight departs on Sunday.
