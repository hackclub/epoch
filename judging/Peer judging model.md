# Peer judging systemmmm!

This is kind of based on [SoME2](https://youtu.be/cDofhN-RJqg).

The idea is that we could have volunteers/participants/comittee of about 20ish people and these people contribute to a final judgement.

## The 20 people
These people could be volunteers or just random participants or comittee on `#epoch-bts`. They get unnamed and unidentified projects. 

## The judging 
These people will be given rubrics as follows

| Creativity | Uniqueness  | Difficulty making | Remarks
| :---:      | :---:       | :---:             | :---:
| x/10 : INT | x/10 : INT  | x/10 : INT        | Comments : STRING

## The peer checking
All peers will judge all projects based on the given rubrics. When all projects have been judged 20ish times, we take the average of the scores to find the final judgement.

## Ties
Ties can be cleared with audience opinion or votes.

## If the project submission quantity > [a large number]
There can be batches of 20 peers and these peers can have a divided amount of projects to judge. Then the averages will be matched for all the projects together.
